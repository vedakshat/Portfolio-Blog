# Portfolio-Blog
This is my personal Portfolio and Blog website.
This is build using HTML, CSS and basic js & jQuery. For the frontend library Materialise framework has been used.

The first page is almost ready and work on blog page is still ongoing.

You can fork this repo and try some changes accordingly and for testing and running the code locally you will just need a good text editor(Vscode is what i prefer) and will have to link the materialise.css framework.

Suggestions, code improvements, issues and discussions are all welcomed.
